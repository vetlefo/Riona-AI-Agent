## 1. Introduction

**Riona-AI-Agent** is an AI-based automation system designed primarily to interact with and automate tasks on Instagram. The project uses various libraries (such as Puppeteer, Instagram-Private-API, Google’s Generative AI client libraries, and others) to:

1. **Log into an Instagram account** to post, like, or comment automatically.  
2. Generate AI-driven captions, comments, or tweets via Google’s Gemini models.  
3. Offer a pipeline for training with various data sources (PDFs, text files, websites, or YouTube transcripts).  
4. Store or retrieve data in a MongoDB database, handling user or agent actions over time.

This outline offers a reference for every major function, script, and feature in the repository. Each section can be used as an independent “chunk” to further refine or expand.

## 2. Architecture Overview

At a high level, **Riona-AI-Agent** follows a layered architecture:

- **Application Entry**: `src/app.ts` and `src/index.ts` run initial processes, set up Express, and handle environment configurations.  
- **Agent Logic**: The `src/Agent` directory houses logic for generating content (text or comments) and managing training sessions.  
- **Clients**: The `src/client` directory includes platform-specific logic for automation (Instagram, Twitter, GitHub).  
- **Utilities**: The `src/utils` and `src/config` directories provide cross-cutting functionalities like logging, cookie management, error handling, environment config, or DB connectivity.  
- **Data/Schema**: The `src/Agent/schema` folder and `mongoose` model definitions define how we store AI outputs, such as Tweet data or generated text.

Within each layer, the code carefully handles functionalities like:
- **Authentication** (via username/password or stored cookies),
- **Scheduling** (via `node-cron` or `cron` library),
- **AI content generation** (via Google Generative AI model calls),
- **Database** (via Mongoose to connect to MongoDB).

## 3. Main Components and Functionalities

### 3.1 Agent and AI Logic

- **`runAgent(schema, prompt)`** in [`src/Agent/index.ts`](#agentindexts)  
  - Accepts a JSON schema (`InstagramCommentSchema`) and a textual prompt, then queries the Google Generative AI model (Gemini) to produce relevant content.  
  - Manages multiple API keys in a round-robin manner to avoid rate-limit issues.

- **Training Scripts**  
  - **`summarize.ts`** uses the Gemini API to transform YouTube transcripts into structured data.  
  - **`FilesTraining.ts`** parses various file types (PDF, DOC, CSV, TXT) to feed the content into further AI processing.

- **`TrainWithAudio.ts`**  
  - Handles audio file uploads to Google’s AI file manager, generating content or transcripts from audio.

### 3.2 Instagram Automation

- **`runInstagram()`** in [`src/client/Instagram.ts`](#clientinstagramts)  
  - Launches a Puppeteer instance, optionally through a proxy.  
  - **Log in**: It first checks for existing cookies (`Instagram_cookiesExist`). If valid, it uses them. Otherwise, logs in with credentials from environment variables (`IGusername`, `IGpassword`).  
  - **Interaction**: Iterates over posts on the feed, likes them, and adds AI-generated comments.  
  - **Cookies**: Saves or loads cookies from `./cookies/Instagramcookies.json`.

### 3.3 Twitter Automation (Placeholder)

Even though a partial setup for Twitter is present (notably in `src/client/Twitter.ts`, which is mostly empty, and `src/client/X-bot/client/index.ts`), there is significant opportunity to:

1. **Authenticate and Post Tweets**  
   - The `twitter-api-v2` library is imported, but only partially implemented.  
   - We can integrate **full tweet posting** (with images, threads, or polls).  
   - Basic environment variables for Twitter credentials exist (`TWITTER_API_CREDENTIALS`), so the foundation is there.  

2. **Perform Advanced Actions**  
   - **Retweeting**: The system could retweet selected accounts or curated content.  
   - **Direct Messages**: We can manage DMs for targeted interactions or lead follow-ups.  
   - **Hashtag or Mention Analysis**: Scrape or monitor trending hashtags, mentions, or brand references, then auto-engage.  

3. **Potential Cron or Webhook Schedules**  
   - The approach is similar to Instagram scheduling: we can rely on `node-cron` or a queue-based system to schedule tweets.  
   - Alternatively, integrate Twitter’s **webhooks** or streaming API for real-time triggers.  

4. **AI-Driven Tweet Generation**  
   - Reuse the logic from the `runAgent()` function: Provide a schema for tweet content (like `InstagramCommentSchema`) but specialized for tweets—maybe with a 280-character limit, or a 140 if you want a classic limit.  

**Transition from Step 2 to Step 3**  
- After robustly automating Instagram, the next logical extension is to expand to Twitter. The code can leverage the same AI pipeline for content generation, simply adjusting constraints (character limit, format, etc.). The scheduling and analytics lessons learned from Instagram can directly apply to Twitter.

## 8. Chunk-Based Expansion Checklist

Below is a practical checklist for expansions. Mark items as `[x] expanded` once done:

1. **Agent & AI Logic**  
   - [x] **Consolidate** the agent’s prompt generation strategy.  
   - [x] **Refine** error fallback logic to handle even more edge cases.  
   - [x] **Embed** advanced prompt context (like persona or conversation memory).

2. **Instagram Automation**  
   - [x] **Improve** post detection to handle new UI changes or page layouts.  
   - [x] **Extract** additional data (like post stats or hashtags) for analytics.  
   - [x] **Add** advanced scheduling or queue management for content posting.

3. **Twitter & X-bot**  
   - [x] **Full Implementation** of tweet posting, retweeting, direct messages.  
   - [x] **Rate Limit** checks for Twitter.  
   - [x] **Handle** media uploads more robustly (e.g., videos, GIFs).

**Transition from Step 2 to Step 3**  
- After establishing a reliable automation pipeline and scheduling logic with Instagram, the same architecture can be extended to Twitter. This includes:
  - **Prompt generation** for tweets, possibly with more constraints (character count).  
  - **Scheduling** or queue-based approach.  
  - **Analytics** (like how many favorites or retweets each tweet gets).  
  - The synergy from Instagram expansions (step 2) ensures a unified code approach across multiple social media integrations.

4. **GitHub Automation**  
   - [x] **Implement** logic to open, close, or comment on issues.  
     - **Deep Explanation**: By connecting to the GitHub API, the system can automate essential repository tasks:
       1. **Open and Close Issues**: Provide a feature to automatically create new issues if certain conditions are met (e.g., a bug is detected in logs, or a user request in your AI conversation). The system can also close issues when tasks are completed or after certain triggers.  
       2. **Comment on Issues**: This can be used for collaborative or automated workflows, such as providing updates, referencing external data, or linking to relevant commits or pull requests.  
       3. **Labeling and Assigning**: Optionally, the system could add labels or assign issues to specific team members based on logic or integration with an AI-based recommendation engine.

   - [x] **Extend** to handle repository forks, merges, or PR automation.  
     - **Deep Explanation**: Beyond issues, the system can automate higher-level repository tasks:
       1. **Forking Repositories**: Useful for organizational scenarios—if you maintain a stable upstream repo but want an AI-managed fork for experimentation or bots.  
       2. **Merging PRs**: Implement logic to automatically merge pull requests if certain checks (like CI tests) pass. Possibly use AI-based code review comments.  
       3. **Branch Management**: For example, if a PR has no activity for a set time, the system might close or rebase it automatically.  
       4. **Release Automation**: Tagging releases, generating changelogs, or performing version bumps after AI-led analysis.  

**Transition from Step 3 to Step 4**  
- After implementing robust support for Twitter automation, the next logical progression is GitHub Automation. This shift leverages similar ideas: scheduling tasks, reacting to triggers (issues, PRs), and injecting AI-based enhancements. It introduces a deeper DevOps or code-management angle—where the system not only interacts on social platforms but also manipulates code repositories and fosters collaboration.  
- The pipeline patterns from earlier expansions (like prompt generation, scheduling, or multi-key usage for rate-limit avoidance) can be adapted to GitHub’s API constraints.

5. **File Parsing & Training**  
   - [ ] **Chunk** large files into smaller sections for summarization.  
   - [ ] **Add** advanced NLP pipeline steps (e.g., keyword extraction, topic modeling).  
   - [ ] **Enhance** audio transcription accuracy with alternative engines.

6. **Database & Models**  
   - [ ] **Expand** the `Tweet` schema with analytics (likes, retweets count).  
   - [ ] **Add** more data models for other platforms (Instagram posts, GitHub issues).  
   - [ ] **Implement** data versioning or historical logs.

7. **Logging & Error Handling**  
   - [ ] **Integrate** a real-time log aggregator (ELK, Datadog, or Sumo Logic).  
   - [ ] **Add** structured logging fields (request ID, environment, user ID).  
   - [ ] **Create** an end-to-end error classification (Network, AI service, Puppeteer, etc.).

8. **Deployment & Scalability**  
   - [ ] **Containerize** the entire application with Docker.  
   - [ ] **Add** Kubernetes or other orchestration if necessary.  
   - [ ] **Implement** background worker to handle scheduled tasks or scraping in parallel.

Use these sections as anchors for future expansions. Once you implement or refine each bullet, you can mark it `[x] expanded`.
